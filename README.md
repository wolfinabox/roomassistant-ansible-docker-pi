# Ansible Playbook for deploying RoomAssistant via docker

Based largely on [mKeRi's ansible playbook here](https://github.com/mKeRix/ansible-playbooks), I just preferred to use docker to simplify dependencies.

More or less follow [their instructions here](https://www.room-assistant.io/guide/quickstart-ansible.html#steps).

Documentation is **#TODO**
